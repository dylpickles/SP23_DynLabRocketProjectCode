# Dynamics Lab Project - SP23
*By Zuriel Joven, Deryck Yin, and Dylan Zhu*

This is a folder for us to maintain all the matlab code we used to simulate our rocket. It's probably overkill but also kinda fun lol

To Owen: 
The "JustClickRun" file is meant to be a user friendly version of our code for you to see how it functions. It should work pretty effortlessly (we hope), if you just run it it should prompt you for input data and spit out a prediction. 

We didn't quite unify all those versions so there's a chance the JustClickRun file is using old code. The latest version of our Model 1 code is in the "IterativeLoop" file. 

The latest version of our Model 2 Code is in the file called "testCode".

Sorry it isn't quite commented as extensively as may be nice for easily understanding the logical flow.
